# Arghive

The name of the project is arbitrary and deliberately whimsical. The goal of the project
is not to invent something cool and do it well (the Unix way) but to erect a composition
of open-source components designed to convert
* (a) a set of high-resolution scans of individual pages of
* (b) a bunch of (tightly or loosely) related documents to
* (c) a searchable, semantically taggable and otherwise navigable personal archive.

The project is dedicated to one Air Force pilot whose (now-digital) archive I am currently processing
and whose name will be revealed once the project itself is at least halfway functional.
